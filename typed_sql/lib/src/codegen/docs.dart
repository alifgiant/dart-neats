/// Documentation for `.where` on [Query], [SubQuery], [QuerySingle] with

    Filter [$target] using `WHERE` clause.

String orderBy(String target) => '''
    Order [$target] using `ORDER BY` clause.

    Returns a [$target] with the same rows as this [$target], but ordered by
    the expressions returned by [builder].

    The [builder] callback must return a list of
    `(Expr<Comparable?>, Order)` records, where the [Order] specifies
    whether results should be sorted in [Order.ascending] or
    [Order.descending] order.

    Regardless of the [Order] given, `null` values are always sorted
    last. If you want `null` values sorted first, you can get this
    behavior using an extra `.isNull()` expression.

    For example:
    ```dart
    final result = await db.books
        .orderBy((book) => [
          // books where title == null will be sorted first now!
          (book.title.isNull(), Order.descending),
          (book.title, Order.ascending),
        ])
